After the first major session of the leaders climate summit a few things are clear.


Numerous technical glitches showed that negotiating via technology is really, really hard.
On the positive side, the US confirmed that it is right back in the mix and with some credibility

Japan, South Korea and Canada put new targets on the table, although campaigners viewed the

the days of coal are numbered.

But it does show that there is significant heavy lifting required by the UK as president of
COP26 before world leaders and their negotiators assemble in Glasgow in November.
